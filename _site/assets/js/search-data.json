In addition to your webpage, you will be responsible for presenting your final results. At the end of the quarter we will have a video showcase for you to share your work. Prior to diving in, it is helpful to gain a sense of what goes into formulating a successful visualization project and to beware of common pitfalls.

We need the following information in the project proposal: . | Project Title | Dataset | Brief writeup of what you intend to do (5-10 lines). | . | Initial Prototype (Fri 03/01, 11:59pm, Can Use Slip Days). Develop an initial prototype of your project and, similar to Project 3, publish it using GitHub pages. This prototype will be used by the course staff to provide feedback on your designs. It is expected that your project will not yet be in a “complete” state; however, by this point you should have the structure of your project laid out, rough prototypes of your main visualization(s) and interactions, and at least basic descriptive text. Each team should submit the URL for their project on Gradescope. | Demo Video (Fri 03/08, 11:59pm, Can Use Slip Days). You must produce a demo video (not to exceed 2 minutes in length) that introduces and explains your project. Your video can take the form of a narrated demo of your project, and may include additional content as you see fit. We will share the videos in class on 03/14. More information about preparing the video is available in the project deliverables section. | Deliverables (Sat 03/16, 11:59pm). Publish your final project web page.

Online Visualization . Your final project visualizations must be published on GitHub pages. For your visualizations you need to utilize D3.js. Keep your source code (HTML markup, visualization JavaScript code, etc.) in the top-level of your GitLab repo. When ready to publish, place all necessary files in the “docs” subfolder to publish on GitHub pages. Video Presentation . In addition to your interactive web page, each team must produce a short demonstration video (no longer than 2 minutes!) introducing your project. Your video must communicate the specific topic and goals of your project along with your visualization designs. We expect most videos will use a mixture of static slides and interactive screen capture with overlaid narration. You might consider showing your web page as published on the web. Alternatively, you might create a stripped down version that removes text in favor of spoken narration, bringing more focus and screen space to your visualizations. The initial frame of your video should include your project name and the team members’ names. Be sure that your video communicates how your visualization designs enable a better understanding of your chosen data. Do not simply enumerate the various features you implemented: focus on what viewers can learn from your visualization(s). Please carefully read the video production guide for details on how to design and record your video. Your videos should be in MPEG4 (.mp4, .m4v) format. Use appropriate compression to ensure your video file is not unnecessarily large. You will post videos online, so we encourage you to put your best face forward to the world! . Your demo video must be published on YouTube. In addition you must submit a URL linking to your video via Gradescope by Fri 03/08, 11:59pm.

You are also free to incorporate additional external data. Your chart image should be interpretable without needing to reference your write-up. Do not forget to include title, axis labels, or legends as needed! . As different visualizations can emphasize different aspects of a data set, your write-up should document what aspects of the data you are attempting to most effectively communicate. In short, what story are you trying to tell? Just as important, also note which aspects of the data might be obscured due to your visualization design. Your write-up should provide a rigorous rationale for your design decisions. Document the visual encodings you used and why they are appropriate for the data and your specific question.

It’s crucial to recognize how the design of a visualization can affect what people understand and remember from the data. In this task, you need to pick a dataset you find interesting and create two static visualizations using the same dataset. The first should be a truthful representation of the data.

    "content": "Your objective is to create two static (single image) visualizations of a selected dataset. The first visualization should be designed to clearly and sincerely convey insights from the data. In contrast, the second should be crafted to intentionally mislead the viewer, causing them to make incorrect inferences. Additionally, you are required to write a brief explanation, limited to four paragraphs, outlining your design strategy for both visualizations. In this task, an earnest visualization is defined as one that: . | Is easily understandable and can be interpreted by the general public. | Uses visual encodings that are suitable and effective for the desired purpose. | Clearly and openly describes any transformations made to the data. | Transparently communicates the source of the data and any possible biases involved. | . Conversely, a deceptive visualization typically displays these characteristics: . | The graphical depiction is deliberately unsuitable or deceptive. | Headings are crafted to influence the viewer’s understanding in a biased manner. | There is intentional manipulation or selective filtering of data to deceive. | It’s not transparent about possible bias present in the data. | . For the earnest visualization, your goal is to be as clear and transparent as possible to help viewers answer your intended question. For the deceptive visualization, your goal is to trick the viewer (including the course staff!) into believing that the visualization is legitimate and earnest. It should not be immediately obvious which visualization is trying to be deceptive. Subtle ineffective choices in the design should require close and careful reading to be identified. For the deceptive visualization, misleading strategies are fine but outright lying is not. For example, sketchy, unreliable or untrustworthy input datasets are discouraged, but misleading omission, filtering, or transformation of trustworthy data records is fine. Deliberate lies in the title, axes, labels, or annotations is discouraged, but technically true/relevant but otherwise misleading text in the visualization is fine. For both visualization designs, start by choosing a question you would like to answer. Design your visualization to answer that question either correctly (for the earnest visualization) or incorrectly (for the deceptive visualization). You may choose to address a different question with each visualization. Be sure to document the question as part of the visualization design (e.g., title, subtitle, or caption) and in your assignment write-up. Your write-up should contain the following information: . | The specific question each visualization aims to answer. | A description of your design rationale and important considerations for each visualization. | .

You must use the same dataset for both visualizations, but you may transform the data differently, use additional data variables, or choose to address a different question for each design. These datasets are intentionally chosen to cover politically charged topics for the simple reason that these are typically the types of data where deceptive visualizations may proliferate. Data on Energy by Our World in Data, 1900-2022 . Our World in Data, a non-profit that gathers and analyzes data about global issues, has published data about energy usage for countries (e.g. coal consumption, hydropower consumption, etc.) around the world since 1900. You can download the data here. Education Data . Every year, the federal government releases large amounts of data on US schools, districts, and colleges. However, this information is scattered across multiple datasets. Urban Institute’s Education Data Explorer tries to fix this issue by putting together data from various sources such as the National Center for Education Statistics’ Common Core of Data (CCD), the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), the US Department of Education’s EDFacts, and IPUMS’ National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) and makes it available as an API. You can download the data by making an API call using the code available on the website or alternatively clicking on the downloads button on the website. Internet Usage Data . UNdata brings international statistical databases within easy reach of users through a single-entry point. It is maintained by the Development Data Section of the Development Data and Outreach Branch within the Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) of the UN Secretariat. You can find the internet usage data here. Feel free to take a look at some of the other datasets made available by UNdata here. This data has the following columns: . | Region/country Code: code representing the country or region. | Region or Country Name: Field containing the country name. | Year: Field containing the year at which the data was collected. | Value: Field denoting the Percentage of individuals using the internet. | Source: Field denoting the source of the data. | .

Note what you discover and learn about the data set, and what properties lead you to a particular conclusion. You must identify which visualization you believe to be intentionally deceptive, along with a rationale indicating which design elements led you to this conclusion. Next, author constructive critiques for each visualization design. Consider the following concerns: . | Are expressive and effective visual encodings applied? | How well does the choice of encodings they reveal the most important features or trends of the underlying data? | Is critical data easily seen, or is it somehow hidden? | Is an audience likely to understand the visualization? | How clear and transparent is the design? | Are elements appropriately titled or labeled? | Is there appropriate spacing, layout, legible type, and other forms of design styling? | Is the overall display confusing or cluttered? | Is there important information missing that is needed to interpret the visualization approapriately? | . To share critique, we will use the “I like / I wish / What if?” format. This involves sharing positive feedback on effective aspects, critical (but respectful!) feedback on what might be improved, and more wild (even half-baked) ideas your fellow students could explore in subsequent design iterations or future work.

    "content": "For this assignment, you will explore the issues involved in implementing interactive visualizations. You will build a visualization that enables interactive exploration of a dataset of your choosing (we do have some suggestions as well which you can find below) and deploy it on the web. One goal of this assignment is to gain familiarity with implementing interaction techniques for visualizations. For example, the zipdecode and NameGrapher applications apply the interactive technique of dynamic queries – as explored in the earlier HomeFinder application – to the problem of uncovering patterns in zip codes and baby names. Similarly, treemaps were originally developed to display hierarchical file structures and were later adapted to the problem of interactively depicting a map of the stock market. We have seen many other examples of interactive visualization techniques in class. The goal of this assignment is not only for you to gain hands-on implementation experience, but also for you to think about the effectiveness of the specific techniques for your chosen data domain. One challenge is to scope the assignment so that you can finish it within two weeks. Focus on designing a limited yet compelling visualization that enables interactive exploration along a few critical dimensions. The NameGrapher application is a nice example that uses a simple but elegant interaction design to enable engaging explorations. A tightly focused, well-implemented interactive graphic is much preferred to a sprawling design that attempts too much! . ",

To determine what subset of the data and which interactive options are most promising, you may want to perform additional exploratory analysis. What aspects of the data reveal the most interesting discoveries or stories? Do not feel obligated to try to convey everything about the data: focus on a compelling subset. Your graphic must include interactions that enable exploration. Possible techniques include panning, zooming, brushing, details-on-demand (e.g., tooltips), dynamic query filters, and selecting different measures to display. You are free to also consider highlights, annotations, or other narrative features intended to draw attention to particular items of interest and provide additional context. Implement your interactive graphic and deploy it to the web. You may only use only D3.js for this project. Vega-lite/Plotly/Altair/any other high-level plotting library or tool are strictly not allowed for this project. You can use other non-plotting related JavaScript libraries, e.g. Lodash, Svelte, Moment, etc. Your graphic should not require customized server-side support; you should simply load data from a static data file or public web API. Please refer to the Tech Support page for instructions on deploying a GitHub Pages website using Svelte. For deploying websites with other libraries, feel free to explore on your own. Using our template to complete this project is not mandatory. You will use GitHub pages to host your visualization from your project repository. Make sure that you make your repository “Public”. We recommend keeping everything (development files and website) in your master branch: either serve your website from the root folder or the “/docs” folder. Your repo must also contain the (unobfuscated) source code for your visualization. Your deployed web page should also include a write-up with the following components: . | A rationale for your design decisions. How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices? . | An overview of your development process. Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)?

(+3 points) | The visualization does not violate the expressiveness criteria, but another set of design choices (marks and encoding channels) could have been more effective (e.g. using the area visual channel instead of position when possible). (+2.5 points) | The visualization violates the expressiveness criteria (e.g. heavy overplotting, encodings that imply incorrect readings, etc.), and these violations are not addressed using the available interactions (e.g. overplotting that cannot be filtered or zoomed into). (+1.5 points) | . | Data Transformations |   | The visualization uses appropriate data transformations (e.g. filtering, aggregating) and clearly describes the transformations to the reader (e.g. in the subtitle of the plot). (+1.5 points) | The visualization used an inappropriate set of data transformations (e.g. filtering out important outliers), or did not clearly describe these transformations to the reader. (+1 point) | . | Interaction | The interactive elements of the plot are polished, mostly bug-free, and enable the reader to discover interesting patterns in the data. (+3.5 points) | The interactive elements of the plot are functional and enable the reader to discover interesting patterns in the data, but a static plot (perhaps with a different encoding) could have conveyed the same information just as effectively. (+3 points) | The plot would have been substantially more effective as a static plot without the interaction; or, the interaction has major bugs that preclude use.

Note that these datasets are the same as the ones from Project 2. Feel free to reuse the dataset you used in Project 2 to speed up your development process. Data on Energy by Our World in Data, 1900-2022 . Our World in Data, a non-profit that gathers and analyzes data about global issues, has published data about energy usage for countries (e.g. coal consumption, hydropower consumption, etc.) around the world since 1900. You can download the data here. Education Data . Every year, the federal government releases large amounts of data on US schools, districts, and colleges. However, this information is scattered across multiple datasets. Urban Institute’s Education Data Explorer tries to fix this issue by putting together data from various sources such as the National Center for Education Statistics’ Common Core of Data (CCD), the Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC), the US Department of Education’s EDFacts, and IPUMS’ National Historical Geographic Information System (NHGIS) and makes it available as an API. You can download the data by making an API call using the code available on the website or alternatively clicking on the downloads button on the website. Internet Usage Data . UNdata brings international statistical databases within easy reach of users through a single-entry point. It is maintained by the Development Data Section of the Development Data and Outreach Branch within the Statistics Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UN DESA) of the UN Secretariat. You can find the internet usage data here. Feel free to take a look at some of the other datasets made available by UNdata here. This data has the following columns: . | Region/country Code: code representing the country or region. | Region or Country Name: Field containing the country name. | Year: Field containing the year at which the data was collected. | Value: Field denoting the Percentage of individuals using the internet. | Source: Field denoting the source of the data. | .

Participation will be tracked using an online form given during class. | Share and critique at least 1 interesting data visualization on Ed under the Critiques category that hasn’t already been shared during class, labs, or projects. To receive credit, the critique needs to have at least 3 paragraphs of around 3-4 sentences each. The three paragraphs should: . | Summarize the visualization and describe how it connects to a lecture concept from the current week or the previous week. If a dataset for the visualization is publicly available, provide a link. | Describe the strengths of this particular visualization. | Describe the weaknesses of this particular visualization. | . | Respond to 2 different visualization critiques from other students on Ed under the Critiques category. To receive credit, each response needs to have at least 2 paragraphs of around 3-4 sentences each. The paragraphs should: . | Explain what parts of the critique you agree and disagree with. | Suggest an improvement for the visualization. You can sketch out your improved visualization or write a program to generate it. | . | . ⚠️If you choose to fulfill lecture participation through option 2 or 3, you must make a public post on EdStem under the Critiques category. In the title of your post or response, clearly state that it is being used as an opportunity to fulfill lecture participation. The deadline for submitting critiques to count for the corresponding week is Sunday at 11:59 PM. Discussions . We will not be using the scheduled discussion sections for this course. We encourage you to attend office hours instead. Labs . There will be 7 lab assignments due weekly throughout the quarter. Each lab assignment is designed to be a walkthrough of practical material that you will use for your projects. Labs are meant to serve as worked examples: the solution code will be given to you as part of the lab. To receive credit for labs, you will need to complete the lab and then get checked off during office hours by a TA. The check off requirements will be clearly described at the end of each lab assignment. Each lab is worth 2% of your final grade, and the lowest lab grade will be dropped. Labs will be released on Fridays and due on the following Fridays at 11:59PM. You will access labs by pulling the course GitHub repository. Projects . There will be 4 projects due throughout the quarter. The projects are open-ended and are the primary focus of the course. As such, our standards for grading will be similar to the way portfolio pieces are evaluated for internship/research lab/job applications — we expect your best work! The first three projects are solo projects. For the final project, you may work in pairs. Working in Pairs . You may work together on the final project (and only the final project!) with a partner. If you work with a partner, you are both required to actively contribute to all parts of the project. You must both be working on the assignment at the same time together, either physically or virtually on a Zoom call. You are encouraged to follow the pair programming model, in which you work on just a single computer and alternate who writes the code and who thinks about the problems at a high level. In particular, you cannot split up the project and each work on separate parts independently. If you work with a partner: . | Only one partner needs to submit the project on Gradescope; this partner should add the other partner to their submission. | You and your partner will receive the same score on any submissions you make together. | . If you are unhappy with your partnership (e.g., if your partner does not keep in touch, does not come prepared to work on the assignment, or does not seem to be engaged in the process), please first address your concerns to your partner, and try to agree on what should be done to make the partnership work well for both of you. If that approach is not successful, explain the issues to the instructors, who will work with you and your partner to improve the situation. Note that you may not work with partners on lab assignments, however you’re encouraged to discuss all assignments with others at a conceptual level in office hours and study groups. Office Hours . To get help on assignments and concepts, course staff will be hosting several office hours per week. The majority of our office hours are held in-person, though a few are held remotely – if you’re able to, you’re strongly encouraged to attend in-person. See the Calendar tab of the course website for the most up-to-date schedule and instructions. Weekly Schedule . To summarize all of the events and deadlines, refer to this general weekly schedule (which is subject to change in any given week): . | Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | . |   |   | Lecture |   | Lecture |   |   | . |   |   |   |   |   | Lab and Project due |   | .

    "content": "Grading . Here is how we’ll compute your grade: . | Component | Weight | Notes | . | Participation | 8% | 1% per week, 2 lowest weeks dropped | . | Labs | 12% | 2% per lab, 1 lowest lab dropped | . | Project 1 | 10% |   | . | Project 2 | 15% | 10% for submission, 5% for peer review | . | Project 3 | 15% | 10% for submission, 5% for peer review | . | Final Project | 40% | 3% for proposal, 7% prototype, 15% video, 15% final submission | . Late Policy, Slip Days, and Drops . All assignments must be submitted by 11:59PM San Diego time on the due date to be considered on time. You may turn them in as many times as you like before the deadline, and only the most recent submission will be graded, so it’s a good habit to submit early and often. If you make a submission after the deadline, your assignment will be counted as late. You have 6 “slip days” to use throughout the quarter. A slip day extends the deadline of an assignment by 24 hours. The number of slip days you can use on an assignment depends on the kind of assignment: . | On labs, you may use up to 1 slip day. Since labs are due on Fridays and require a TA to check off, you may get checked off on the following Monday after a lab deadline to use 1 slip day. | On projects, you may use up to 2 slip days. Projects will not be accepted more than 48 hours after the deadline. Note that you will not be able to use slip days on the Final Project Deliverables due on Saturday, March 16, 2024. | . Slip days are designed to be a transparent and predictable source of leniency in deadlines. You can use a slip day if you are too busy to complete an assignment on its original due date (or if you forgot about it). But slip days are also meant for things like the internet going down at 11:58 PM just as you go to submit your assignment. Slip days are meant to be used in exceptional circumstances, so you probably should not need to use all 6, but if you have something going on in your life that is impeding your ability to do your classwork on time, please reach out to us as soon as possible so we can work something out. Slip days are applied automatically at the end of the quarter, and you don’t need to ask in order to use one. It’s your responsibility to keep track of how many you have left. If you’ve run out of slip days and submit an assignment late, that assignment may still be graded, but you will receive a 0 on it when we calculate grades at the end of the quarter. However, in the event that you use all 6 days and submit another assignment late, we will allocate your slip days first to your projects (in chronological order), then to your labs (in chronological order), and then to other assignments. This is done to prevent you from receiving a 0 on, say, Project 4, if you’ve used all of your slip days on labs up until that point; in such a case, you’d instead receive a 0 on an earlier lab that isn’t weighted as much in your grade. Regrade Requests . If you feel that there in an error in grading, you may submit a regrade request within two days of the grades being released. If you do not submit a regrade request within two days, your original grade will be final. To submit a regrade request for a manually graded problem, make the regrade request directly on Gradescope. Note that part of your grade is clarity, so if your answer was mostly right but unclear you may still not be eligible for full credit. Incompletes . In the unfortunate circumstance that you become sick, suffer a loss, or otherwise experience a significant setback that is outside of your control, you may be eligible for an Incomplete grade, which allows you to complete the rest of the work at a later time. If you are experiencing challenges due to circumstances outside your control, please contact me ASAP and we can discuss the best course of action. Note that an Incomplete does not allow you to re-do work that has already been completed, only to do work that hasn’t been completed, so it’s best to reach out right away. A note on letter grades . The following is adapted from CSE 160 at the University of Washington. Grading for this class is not curved in the sense that the average is set at (say) a B+ and half of the class must receive a grade lower than that. If everyone does well and shows mastery of the material, everyone can receive an A (this would be awesome!). If no one does well (this is unlikely), then everyone can receive a C. Grading for this class is curved in the sense that we do not have a pre-defined mapping from project and exam scores to a final GPA. There is no pre-determined score (e.g., 90% of all possible points) that earns an A or a B or a C or any other grade. To determine the final grade, we will ask questions like “Did this student master the material?”. With that said, grades will not be any stricter than the standard grading scale (where an A+ is a 97+, A is 93+, A- is 90+, etc). For instance, the threshold for an “A” will never be higher than 93%. Try your best not to worry about grades, and we’ll reciprocate by being fair. We’re in this together 😎. ",

    "content": "DSC 106 is known for being a rigorous but rewarding course. While you will be challenged this quarter, we will be offering you plenty of support through office hours and Ed. Make good use of these resources, and you will be able to succeed in this course. There is no excuse for cheating in this course. If you do cheat, we will enforce the UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship. This means you will likely fail the course and the Dean of your college will put you on probation or suspend or dismiss you from UCSD. Students agree that by taking this course, their assignments may be submitted to third-party software to help detect plagiarism. Why is academic integrity important? . Academic integrity is an issue that is pertinent to all students on campus. When students act unethically by copying someone’s work, taking an exam for someone else, plagiarizing, etc., these students are misrepresenting their academic abilities. This makes it impossible for instructors to give grades (and for the University to give degrees) that reflect student knowledge. This devalues the worth of a UCSD degree for all students, making it imperative for the the campus as a whole to enforce that all members of this community are honest and ethical. We want your degree to be meaningful and we want you to be proud to call yourself a graduate of UCSD! . The UCSD Policy on Integrity of Scholarship and this syllabus list some of the standards by which you are expected to complete your academic work, but your good ethical judgment (or asking us for advice) is also expected as we cannot list every behavior that is unethical or not in the spirit of academic integrity. Ignorance of the rules will not excuse you from any violations. What counts as cheating? . In DSC 106, you can read books, surf the web, get inspiration from previous work or AI tools like ChatGPT, talk to your friends and the DSC 106 staff to get help understanding the concepts you need to know to complete your assignments. However, all code must be written by you (or, in the instance of projects, together with your partner). The following activities are considered cheating and are not allowed (not an exhaustive list): . | Using or submitting code acquired from other students (except from your pair programming partner during projects), the web, or any other resource not officially sanctioned by this course | Posting your code online, including on Ed, unless privately to instructors only | Having any other person complete any part of your assignment on your behalf | Completing an assignment on behalf of someone else | Providing code to any other student in the course | Splitting up project questions with your pair programming partner and each working on different questions | . The following activities are examples of appropriate collaboration and are allowed in (not an exhaustive list): . | (new) Using AI code generation tools, such as GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT, to help write your code | Discussing the general approach to solving labs or projects | Talking about problem-solving strategies or issues you ran into and how you solved them | Discussing the answers to exams with other students who have already taken the exam after the exam is complete | Using code provided in class, by the textbook or any other assigned reading or video, with attribution | Using Google to search for documentation. | Working together with other students on assignments without copying or sharing answers | Posting a question about your approach to a problem on Ed, without sharing your code | . How can I be sure that my actions are NOT considered cheating? . The best way to avoid problems is by using your best judgement and remembering to act with Honesty, Trust, Fairness, Respect, Responsibility, and Courage. Here are some suggestions for completing your work: . | Don’t look at or discuss the details of another student’s code for an assignment you are working on, and don’t let another student look at your code. | Don’t start with someone else’s code and make changes to it, or in any way share code with other students. | If you are talking to another student about an assignment, don’t take notes, and wait an hour afterward before you write any code. | .

OSD works with students with documented disabilities to review documentation and determine reasonable accommodations. Disabilities can occur in these areas: psychological, psychiatric, learning, attention, chronic health, physical, vision, hearing, and acquired brain injuries, and may occur at any time during a student’s college career. We encourage you to contact the OSD as soon as you become aware of a condition that is disabling so that we can work with you. If you already have accommodations via OSD, please make sure that we receive your Authorization for Accommodation (AFA) letter by the end of Week 1 so that we can make arrangements for accommodations. Share your AFA letter with the instructor and the Data Science OSD Liaison, who can be reached at dscstudent@ucsd.edu. Diversity and Inclusion . We are committed to an inclusive learning environment that respects our diversity of perspectives, experiences, and identities. Our goal is to create a diverse and inclusive learning environment where all students feel comfortable and can thrive. If you have any suggestions as to how we could create a more inclusive setting, please let us know.

    "content": "Labs and projects in DSC 106 are mostly coding assignments, so it’s important to make sure that your computing environment is set up properly. You will need to use DataHub for the first lab. You will need Git, VSCode, and Node to complete all other labs and projects. Git . All of our course materials, including your assignments, are hosted on GitHub in this Git repository. This means that you’ll need to download and use Git to work with the course materials. Git is a version control system. In short, it is used to keep track of the history of a project. With Git, you can go back in time to any previous version of your project, or even work on two different versions (or \"branches\") in parallel and \"merge\" them together at some point in the future. We'll stick to using the basic features of Git in DSC 106. There are Git GUIs, and you can use them for this class. You can also use the command-line version of Git. To get started, you'll need to \"clone\" the course repository. The command to do this is: . git clone https://github.com/dsc-courses/dsc106-sp24 . This will copy the repository to a directory on your computer. To bring in the latest version of the repository, run git pull in your local repository. This will not overwrite your work. In fact, Git is designed to make it very difficult to lose work (although it's still possible!). Merge Conflicts . You might face issues when using git pull regarding merge issues and branches. This is caused by files being updated on your side while we are also changing the Git repository by pushing new assignments on our side. Here are some steps you can follow to resolve it: . NOTE: Whenever working with GitHub pulls, merges, etc., it’s a good idea to save your important work locally so that if you accidentally overwrite your files you still have the work saved. Save your work locally before following the steps below. | git status shows the current state of your Git working directory and staging area. It’s a good sanity check to start with. You will probably see your project and lab files that you have worked on. | git add . will add all your files to be ready to commit. | git commit -m \"some message of your choice\" will commit the files, with some description in the quotations. This can be whatever you want, it won’t matter. | . At this stage, if you git pull, it should work. You should double-check that you have new files, as well as that your old files are unchanged. If they are changed then you should be able to just copy-paste from your local backup. If this does not work then you may have merge conflicts, follow the next steps: . | git checkout --theirs [FILENAME] will tell git that whenever a conflict occurs in [FILENAME] to keep your version. Run this for each file with a conflict. | git add [FILENAME] to mark each file with a conflict as resolved. | git rebase --continue or git merge, depending on the setup. | . VS Code . To create, write, and edit our code, we are going to use a code editor. For this class, we are going to provide support for VS Code. If you want to use another code editor, feel free to do so, but keep in mind that we may not be able to recreate the problems that you may run into. You may download VS Code from here. In order to make our lives easier when we develop websites, we are going to use some VS Code extensions. Up to lab 6, it is only necessary to install the following two extensions. Come back when you need to work on lab 6; more information (related to Node installation) will be updated. Prettier . This is an extension that will help us keep our code clean and tidy. Click “Install” on the webpage. It will redirect to your VSCode; then, click “Install” again to install the extension. Live Preview . This will host a local server in our workspace for us to preview our web pages on. Click “Install” on the webpage. It will redirect to your VSCode; then, click “Install” again to install the extension. Svelte for VS Code . Starting Lab4, you are going to use Svelte. This will help you with svelte components. Click “Install” on the webpage. It will redirect to your VSCode; then, click “Install” again to install the extension. ",
